            the integration of backend technology to allow for functionalities
            such as account login/OAuth and score tracking with Redux store. The
            React360 library facilitated the production of a complex, c UI due
            to its use of familiar and interactive React components as well as
            the access to React Native’s Animated library for rendering
            animations. Redux state management library to hold the state of the
            current background, clues, and currently enabled buttons as the
